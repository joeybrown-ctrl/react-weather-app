  ## Description 

A weather app built using React, React Hooks, OpenWeatherMap's forecast APIs and Semantic UI for styling. React's useEffect and useState hooks are used to set state for data, which is passed down as props to a React component. This is a project I intend to grow over time, utilizing more of OpenWeatherMap's free resources presented with Semantic UI styling in React components. 

This project is deployed to Netlify. Check it out [here](https://vigilant-williams-8f3807.netlify.app/).
